	  Maalka and Architecture 2030 have developed the Energy
	  Target and Rating Tool for building owners and 2030 members
	  to effectively compare their energy-use intensity (EUI) with
	  similar building types.  This helps to understand a
	  building’s EUI efficiency change over time, and to set
	  targets for achieving desired performance scores based on
	  2003 CBECS data. Basing the tool functionality on the 2003
	  CBECS dataset enables 2030 members to maintain pre-existing
	  goals and baselines so that progress can continue to be
	  consistently measured.
